# Simple Scrolling Game

This was a project I made when I was beginning to learn Python.

## How to Play the Game

In this game, there are three different circles on the screen. The blue circle is you, the player. The red circle is the circle you want to avoid, as you will lose lives if you hit it. Lastly, the green circle is the one you want to hit as each time you hit it you gain a point. To move your player, you use the up arrow key to move up and the down arrow key to move down. After you hit the red cicle 3 times, the game is over.

## Goal of the Game

The goal of the game is to score as many points as you can.
